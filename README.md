The aim of the project was to design and implement a web application which could act as a advertising service. The application should allow the users to:
- Create and modify advertisements (tasks) for additional work (odd-jobs)
- Browse the already added ads
- Ability to send a proposal for the execution of a task to the user who created the ad and the ability to approve the proposal
- Possibility of creating and deleting an opinion related to the accomplished tasks.

The application is focusing on creating advertisements regarding small services. It could also help people who are interested in part-time job opportunities in their neighbourhood.
